Whurr

Whurr is a to-be alternative for Apache Whirr. All the features are not yet implemented. It is a bit clumsy. It currently only instantiates Hadoop clusters. 

The Shell currently loads Hadoop, and a lot more on the stack.

It loads
R
Protobuf
Tessera Stack (previously known as RHIPE stack)
These things can be ignored by just commenting out the code. 

You could run it as $ ./whurr.py or $ python whurr.py
